Backend Refactor, Optimization and Testing
1. Refactored Blocking I/O
All usages of fs.readFileSync and fs.writeFileSync were replaced by asynchronous, non-blocking operations using fs.promises.readFile and fs.promises.writeFile.

Data reading/writing is now fully async/await, ensuring the Node.js event loop is never blocked.

2. /api/stats Performance Optimization
Implemented in-memory caching for /api/stats endpoint.

The endpoint only recalculates statistics if the items.json file has changed (using mtimeMs via fs.stat).

If the file is unchanged, cached results are served instantly.

Trade-off: for multi-process/cluster setups, a distributed cache (like Redis) would be recommended; for this scope, single-process in-memory cache is sufficient.

3. Error Handling Improvements
Unified error handling using a global Express error handler (errorHandler middleware).

Custom errors (like 404s) now return their intended HTTP status codes.

All unhandled errors are returned as HTTP 500.

All error responses are consistent, clear, and production-ready.

4. Payload Validation
Added strict validation to POST /api/items to require name (non-empty string) and price (non-negative number).

Invalid payloads now receive a 400 Bad Request with a clear error message.

5. Comprehensive Unit Tests
All item routes are covered by unit tests using Jest and supertest.

Test cases include:

Happy path for all endpoints.

Error handling for missing items, file read failures, and invalid payloads.

All file operations (fs/promises) are mocked to ensure isolated and fast tests.

6. Code Clean-up
Removed unused and misleading code, such as the getCookie stub, which was not relevant to any route or requirement.

Ensured the codebase is focused, clear, and free from distractions.

7. Logger Middleware
The original codebase included a stub for a custom logger middleware:

```js
module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.method, req.originalUrl);
  next();
};
```

Analysis and Best Practice:

For real-world logging, the project already uses morgan, which provides richer HTTP request logs by default.

The stub logger is redundant in this setup and can be safely removed.

For advanced use cases, a custom middleware can be implemented to include response time, status codes, etc., but morgan is the recommended choice for production.

Trade-offs and Further Recommendations
For higher concurrency or horizontal scaling, migrate file operations to a database and cache stats in a distributed cache.

For even stronger payload validation, consider using a schema validator like Joi or Yup.

All error and edge cases have been handled according to best practices for maintainability and security.

The backend is fully refactored, optimized, and robustly tested, and is ready for production or further feature development.
